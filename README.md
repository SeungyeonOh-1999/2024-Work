# Gravitational Wave Analysis

This repository contains Python codes related to **statistical methods and deep learning models** used in gravitational wave analysis.
I'm planning to conduct various toy examples (not using real data) to study methods referenced in related papers, books or advised by ChatGPT.
There may be inappropriate code that includes syntax or logic errors. If you find any, please email me.  


🙏 **Due to security concerns at NIMS, I cannot provide the gravitational wave data possessed by my lab.** 🙏
